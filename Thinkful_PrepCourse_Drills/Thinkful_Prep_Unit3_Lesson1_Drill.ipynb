If we had a small, skewed data set (for example, (2,3,6,7,34), the mean would not a good measure of central tendancy due to an extreme value being part of such a small data set. I would certanly not choose the mode. The mode is useful when there are lots of repeated data points in a set. Then the most repeated point may be close to the center.
